# Services and API Data

Most of the time, the models we use will be hooked up to API calls within the backend. To do this, we use `services` in order to establish the communication between the frontend and backend. These are done via websocket, but use a Below is an example of how to set up a service:

Use `kosui model --name service-example --container --dataServices` to set up a model, give it a name (in this case `service-example`) then set up a container model, and include services.

The CLI tool will provide most of what you need to get started, just missing the api path. Use the API explorer tool within the simulator to find the url, and typescript autocomplete will enable you to type in the path and see what routes are available.

Once the proper path is in place, you can call the service within the `service-example-container` model, then add a method to add the `Troubles` models.

<Snippet name="initialize@service-example-container-model.ts" />

<Snippet name="update@service-example-container-model.ts" />

Once we have that, we can set up the constructor of the `service-example` model to handle the options.

In order to view the API calls happening, you can open the web socket browser, which will show the request and response of the API call.

<Snippet name="ServiceExampleConstructor@service-example-model.ts" />

We can then create a hook with `kosui hook -i` and a component with `kosui component -i` and within the component, use the hook iterate over the list as normal, and render the name of each service-example.

## Declarative Service calls

In order to make service calls more declarative, KOS provides the `@kosServiceCall` decorator, which can be used to decorate methods within a model. This will automatically handle the service call and allow you to focus on the data returned.

The decorator takes an options object, which includes the service path, method, the lifecycle to attach it to, and any parameters needed.

<Snippet name="declarative@service-example-container-model.ts" />

More advanced options include the ability to add query parameters, headers, and body data. This allows for more complex service calls to be made with ease. These can be found in the SDK documentation.
